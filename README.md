## Current Issues:

### After updating my watch to wearOS 4.0 / OneUI 5 the app crashes when pressing "load" to update accounts via bluetooth

Even if it worked previously in wearOS 3.5, somehow the permissions got reworked / reset with the update. Maybe it will be considered in future updates of the weaOTP watch app. Until then simply grant the app manually the permission to "Nearby devices" in Settings / Apps / Permission Manager again, so it can access the bluetooth connection and you can sync again like before.
